# Adelaide Theatre Sports Club Hub

## Description
The Adelaide Theatre Sports Club Hub is a single-page web app, created to be the main point of communication for the Adelaide Theatre Sports Club Team and their fans and members. The brief set by my uni was to create a page for a sports club so I invented the Adelaide Theatre Sports Club. I had to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the page, and it had to include:
  1. a navigation bar
  2. a footer
  3. a photo carousel
  4. videos
  5. and a form.

## Compatibility
This SPA will contain media queries so that it hopefully will open in mobile, tablet and desktop view.

## Project status
I am currently halfway through my course and this project is due in a few weeks so bare with me while I gradually complete it. I am aiming to complete HTML week 1, CSS week 2 and finally JavaScript in week 3. Wish me luck!
